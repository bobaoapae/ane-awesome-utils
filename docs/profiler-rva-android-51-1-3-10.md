# Profiler Hook Offsets for Adobe AIR 51.1.3.10 (Android `libCore.so`)

Static binary analysis of `libCore.so` (the AIR Android runtime, analogue of
`Adobe AIR.dll` on Windows) for the `.aneprof` backend hooks. All offsets are
relative to the loaded `libCore.so` base address — at runtime,
`AndroidGcHook` / `AndroidDeepMemoryHook` resolve them against the in-memory
load address obtained via `dl_iterate_phdr`.

> **Pinning by build-id.** Android `libCore.so` ships without symbol tables,
> and Adobe scrubbed all C++ RTTI (`_ZTV*`/`_ZTI*`) and most exports.
> Offsets vary across SDK builds and architectures, so each hook keeps a
> `kKnownBuilds[]` table mapping the GNU build-id → known offsets. Unknown
> build-ids fall back to a logged warning and disable the affected hook
> rather than wild-patching memory.

## Target binaries

| Architecture | Path | Build-ID (GNU) | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| arm64-v8a   | `C:/AiRSDKs/AIRSDK_51.1.3.10/lib/android/lib/arm64-v8a/libCore.so`   | `7dde220f62c90358cfc2cb082f5ce63ab0cd3966` | 49.0 MB |
| armeabi-v7a | `C:/AiRSDKs/AIRSDK_51.1.3.10/lib/android/lib/armeabi-v7a/libCore.so` | `582a8f65b8dcb741e5eb869ccf9526137270d99e` | 14.2 MB |

Devices used for live validation:
- arm64-v8a → OnePlus 15 (PVP 30min + PVP 3x scenarios)
- armeabi-v7a → Galaxy A10 (PVP 30min smoke)

## Method

The Windows analysis (51.1.3.12 Ghidra project at
`C:/AiRSDKs/AIRSDK_51.1.3.12/binary-optimizer/`) provides ground-truth
function identities — Adobe annotated the Windows DLLs with full vtable/class
names. The Android binaries are stripped, so cross-arch correlation went:

1. **String anchors** — telemetry/scout markers (`.gc.CollectionWork`,
   `MMgcThrowOutOfMemory`, `gcheap-arena`, `GCHeap::Decommit`) survive on
   Android in `.rodata` and provide unambiguous xrefs.
2. **Structural pattern match** — once a function is identified by string,
   its body shape (size-class lookup, free-list pop, mutex acquisition) is
   matched against the analogous Windows decompile to confirm.
3. **Build-id pinning** — Adobe rebuilds with each SDK bump regenerate
   layout. The GNU build-id (32 bytes from `PT_NOTE`) is stable per build
   and used as the offset-table key.
4. **Live validation** — every offset in `kKnownBuilds[]` is exercised by
   the corresponding hook before release. PVP 30min on each device confirms
   no SIGSEGV at the patched site and the expected event flow.

Tooling: `tools/ghidra-scripts/` contains the headless Java scripts used:
- `find_avm2_natives_v3.java` — substring search + xref enumeration for AS3
  method names
- `find_xrefs_to_addr.java` — generic xref-to-address finder
- `find_bl_calls_to.java` — AArch64 BL scanner for direct callers
- `list_funcs_near.java` — function inventory in an offset window

## Offsets

### Phase 5 — `MMgc::FixedMalloc::Alloc` + `MMgc::GCHeap::Alloc` + Free pair

`AndroidDeepMemoryHook` shadowhooks four MMgc entry points: the per-size-class
fast path inside `FixedMalloc::Alloc` (free-list pop, no libc call), the
chunk-grow path in `GCHeap::Alloc`, the chunk-level allocator
`FixedMalloc::ChunkAlloc`, and its dual `MMgc::Free`. Combined coverage on
PVP 3x ARM64: **6.3M alloc events in 802MB capture, 547× more than
GCHeap-only** — confirms the FixedMalloc fast path is the dominant runtime
allocator inside MMgc.

| Build-ID | `GCHeap::Alloc` | `FixedMalloc::Alloc` | `ChunkAlloc` | `MMgc::Free` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `7dde220f...` (arm64-v8a) | `+0x89c42c` | `+0x8a11d8` | `+0x8a15a4` | `+0x8a167c` | All 4 hooks active; chunk-walk sweep on Free |
| `582a8f65...` (armeabi-v7a) | `+0x5541cd` (Thumb +1) | n/a | TBD | TBD | FixedMalloc inlined into GCHeap callers; only GCHeap hook active |

ARMv7 toolchain inlined `FixedMalloc::Alloc` into the GCHeap callers — the
size-class binner uses `__aeabi_uidivmod` for `/104` (entry stride) where
ARM64 uses `madd`. Static RA can't isolate a clean entry. Coverage on
ARMv7 is 10–30× lower than ARM64 in PVP captures — accepted tradeoff
(documented in PROGRESS.md Iter N+19).

#### `MMgc::Free` + `ChunkAlloc` pair (arm64-v8a)

The pair at `+0x8a15a4` (Alloc) and `+0x8a167c` (Free) tracks
**page-aligned chunks**, which is a different tier than the
user-pointers `proxy_GCHeapAlloc` / `proxy_FixedAlloc` track. Without
`proxy_ChunkAlloc` recording the chunk_base, Free events at `+0x8a167c`
arrive with chunk-aligned ptrs that have no matching shard entry (off
by header offset, e.g. user_ptr = chunk_base + 0x10 for size=64KB).
With both hooks installed, the chunk_base lives in the shard map the
Free queries → frees match cleanly.

**RA method.** Empirical hit-count comparison via the
`AndroidExperimentHook` framework: 16 candidate offsets in `+0x8a15a4
.. +0x8a2ec8` (selected by `stp ..., [sp, #-N]!` function-entry scan)
were light-installed concurrently and exercised by 64MB ByteArray
churn. The Alloc/Free pair at `+0x8a15a4`/`+0x8a167c` was identified
by **identical 59:59 hits** — the strongest signal in the candidate
table. Disassembly confirmed the 2-arg signature `void(this, ptr)`
and matching body shape (mutex-protected sub of size from total
counter at `[this+0x1118]`, page-header lookup at `(ptr & ~0xfff) +
0x22`).

**Chunk-walk sweep.** Adobe inlined the per-class
`MMgc::FixedAlloc::Free` on this AArch64 build — `grep ldxr|stxr`
over `+0x890000..+0x8b0000` returns **zero** matches, so no atomic
free-list operations remain as standalone functions to hook. To
compensate, `proxy_MMgcFree` calls
`dpc->record_free_chunk_sweep(chunk_base, chunk_size)` after the
original. The sweep walks the 32 allocation shards, collects ptrs in
`[chunk_base, chunk_base + chunk_size)`, and emits FreeIfTracked
events for each — implicitly reclaiming the finer-tier user-pointers
Phase 5's alloc proxies tracked within that chunk. Per chunk Free:
~10000 entries scanned across 32 shards, asynchronous through the
writer queue.

This closes the `live_allocations` parity gap with Windows
(`hook_mmgc_free` semantics) without the per-class Free hook that
Adobe's AArch64 build inlined away.

### Phase 7a — `MMgc::GC::Collect` (observer + programmatic trigger)

`AndroidGcHook` shadowhooks `GC::Collect` to emit `GcCycleEvent`s on each
runtime collection. The hook also stashes `this` (x0/r0) on first fire as
the recovered GC singleton — `requestCollect()` re-invokes the original
with the captured pointer, satisfying the programmatic trigger requirement
without finding a global pointer.

| Build-ID | `GC::Collect` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `7dde220f...` (arm64-v8a) | `+0x896824` | Body emits `.gc.CollectionWork` Scout marker |
| `582a8f65...` (armeabi-v7a) | `+0x5501e1` (Thumb +1) | Same logical structure, ARMv7 alignment differs at `this` flags offset |

Static call-site analysis (`find_bl_calls_to.java`) found **zero direct BL
callers** on ARM64 — Adobe dispatches `Collect` via fn-pointer/vtable.
Combined with stripped MMgc RTTI, chasing the global GC pointer through
.bss/.data is impractical (multi-week, low confidence). The runtime
singleton capture is the canonical solution.

### Phase 6 — EGL/GLES render hooks

Not in `libCore.so`. `AndroidRenderHook` shadowhooks the Android system
GLES libraries via two distinct binding strategies — both vendor-agnostic
(work on Adreno, Mali, Xclipse). No `libCore.so` build-id pinning needed.

**v1 — `shadowhook_hook_sym_name(libGLESv2.so, ...)`.** Patches the
exported prologue of:

- `libEGL.so:eglSwapBuffers` — frame boundary signal
- `libGLESv2.so:glDrawArrays` / `glDrawElements` — draw_calls + primitive_count

These bind correctly through the lib-exported trampoline because Adobe's
draw call sites resolve them at the libGLESv2.so entry.

**v2 — `eglGetProcAddress(sym)` + `shadowhook_hook_func_addr`.** Resolves
the symbol via `eglGetProcAddress`, then patches the resulting address.
Required for the texture/clear/bind family:

- `glClear` — clear_count
- `glTexImage2D` — texture_create_count + texture_create_bytes (level 0)
- `glTexSubImage2D` — texture_update_count + texture_upload_bytes
- `glBindTexture` — set_texture_count
- `glBindFramebuffer` — render_target_change_count

**Why eglGetProcAddress and not dlsym for v2?** Adobe AIR caches GLES
function pointers at boot via `eglGetProcAddress`, which on
vendor-specific implementations (Adreno on Cat S60, Mali on Galaxy J5,
Xclipse on Galaxy S25) returns the vendor implementation entry point —
**not** the libGLESv2.so trampoline that `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, sym)`
resolves. Empirical proof: a previous dlsym-based binding installed
cleanly on Cat S60 but fired zero times during 196 frames of dynamic
Hall rendering (texture_create=0, set_texture=0, clear_count=0). After
switching to `eglGetProcAddress`, all v2 metrics began populating
immediately on the same workload (198 clear / 6749 set_texture /
415 tex_update / 115 MB upload across 198 frames).

The v1 hooks (`glDraw*`, `eglSwapBuffers`) keep using
`shadowhook_hook_sym_name` because they bind correctly there.

### Phase 3 — AS3 method walker (TLS-probe based)

`AndroidAirRuntime` does not use static offsets. Instead it probes the
thread-local CallStack at install time to discover the offset where AVM2
records the active `MethodInfo*`. Cross-arch and cross-SDK robust by
construction. See `AndroidAirRuntime.cpp` for the probe protocol.

### Phase 0 — `alloc_tracer` libc shadowhooks

PLT/GOT patches on `libc.so:malloc/calloc/realloc/free/mmap/munmap`. No
`libCore.so` offsets needed. Reentrancy fix (Iter N+15) moved
`t_in_tracer` guard to proxy entry with a size-filter-first ordering to
avoid TLS access on small allocations (NDK r28 `__emutls_get_address`
calls libc malloc on first thread_local touch — recursion).

### Phase 4c — AS3 typed alloc via VTable→Traits→Stringp walk (LIVE)

**Status: validated on Galaxy A10 ARMv7 (build-id `582a8f65...`)**.

Plan B unblocked via two findings during the phase4c-ra multi-agent pass:

1. **arm64-mapper** (against analysis-output/android-arm64/all_functions_decompiled.c):
   the entire AArch64 51.1.3.12 MMgc allocator stack — `FixedMalloc::Alloc +
   FixedAlloc::InlineAllocSansHook + GCAlloc::Alloc + GC::Alloc +
   GCHeap::Alloc` — collapses into ONE universal `malloc`-shim function
   (`FUN_0099b4f8`). "BitmapData / Atom / ScriptObject / String all funnel
   through it." On the corresponding 51.1.3.10 ARM64 build the entry is
   `+0x8a11d8` (already in `kKnownBuilds[]`), and on ARMv7 51.1.3.10 the
   analogous universal entry is **`+0x5541cd`** — the same address already
   wired as `gcheap_alloc_offset` in `AndroidDeepMemoryHook`. The 23 caller
   functions all invoke it with `(size, flags)` per `FixedMallocOpts` — no
   second allocator layer exists, so no extra hookpoint is needed.

2. **source-analyst** (against `binary-optimizer/avmplus/MMgc/`):
   - `String` inherits from RCObject so its `m_buffer/m_length/m_flags`
     offsets all add an extra V (4 ARMv7 / 8 AArch64) for the `composite`
     field that the original LayoutOffsets struct missed.
   - The recommended hookpoint at the source level is `GCAlloc::Alloc`,
     but in the malloc-shim build the entire stack collapses into a single
     entry, making the per-class chokepoint analysis moot.

Layout offsets validated by an in-walker auto-discovery probe added in
`AndroidAs3ObjectHook.cpp`. The probe tries every (vtable_off × traits_off ×
name_off) combo on every unresolved alloc and reports per-combo hit
counts at uninstall:

```
discover: vtable=+8 traits=+32 name=+72 hits=35   <-- TOP for ARMv7
discover: vtable=+8 traits=+16 name=+72 hits=11
discover: vtable=+16 traits=+24 name=+72 hits=12
discover: vtable=+24 traits=+24 name=+72 hits=30
```

The source-derived `vtable_traits_off = V*5` (= 20 on ARMv7) gave **zero**
hits. The actual offset is **V*8 = 32** — Adobe's release VTable has three
extra pointer-sized fields between the open-source `ivtable` and `traits`
(likely cached prototype/ctor/native-ID slots gated behind a build flag in
the OSS sources). Same shift applied to AArch64 (V*8 = 64), pending live
validation on OnePlus 15.

**ARMv7 PVP-3x soak validation** (~10 min capture):

| Class                  | Count |
|------------------------|-------|
| CrazyTankSocketEvent   | 207   |
| RoomInfo               |  79   |
| RoomPlayer             |  59   |
| PackageIn              |  39   |
| FastEvent              |  28   |
| RoomPlayerAction       |  17   |
| DictionaryEvent        |  12   |
| (various game managers) | …    |

579 typed `as3_alloc` markers + 592k untyped alloc events on the same
stream. The 0.1% typed ratio is the expected steady-state — most allocs
through the universal entry are non-ScriptObject (chunks, raw bytes,
strings, ABC bytecode buffers).

### Phase 4a — `IMemorySampler` typed AS3 alloc

Adobe stripped the entire `IMemorySampler` interface from Android
`libCore.so`. No vtable, no string anchors (`presample`,
`recordAllocationSample`, `recordDeallocationSample` not present), no
indirect xrefs. Confirmed via headless string scan + symbol enumeration in
Iter N+18. **Phase 4c (above) supersedes Phase 4a** for typed allocation
capture — typed names come from a Traits walk, not a Sampler hook.

### Phase 4b — AS3 reference graph

Same RTTI strip blocks `DisplayObjectContainer::addChild` /
`EventDispatcher::addEventListener` resolution. The AS3 method-name strings
that DO survive in `.rodata` are part of the embedded SWF ABC string pool
(packed Pascal-prefixed pool at e.g. ARMv7 `+0xc89b00`), not a runtime
native dispatch table. Adobe's AVM2 dispatches AS3 methods via 32-bit
indices in compiled Trait tables — no name-based runtime lookup exists to
hook.

Skipped.

| 7b — recordFrame | ✅ Frame events | ✅ Frame events |

Tooling for SDK-bump verification:
1. Pull `libCore.so` from new `AIRSDK_*/lib/android/lib/{arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a}/`
2. Compute build-id via `readelf -n libCore.so | grep "Build ID"`
3. Run Ghidra headless with anchor scripts (`find_avm2_natives_v3.java`)
4. Confirm string anchors `.gc.CollectionWork`, `MMgcThrowOutOfMemory`,
   `gcheap-arena` still present
5. Locate new offsets by structural match against the previous build's
   decompile
6. Append entry to `kKnownBuilds[]` in each hook
7. Live PVP 30min on both devices to validate

## Pulling captures off-device — binary safety

When pulling `.aneprof` files via `adb`, **always use `adb exec-out`**, NOT
`adb shell cat`. The shell variant routes through a TTY which performs
LF→CRLF translation, corrupting binary records (1-byte gap inserted after
every 0x0a byte in the stream). A 683 KB capture had 1152 such corruptions,
making the validator reject the file as malformed.

```bash
# CORRECT — binary-safe
adb -s <serial> exec-out 'run-as br.com.redesurftank.android cat "<path>"' > local.aneprof

# WRONG — TTY translation corrupts binary
adb -s <serial> shell 'run-as br.com.redesurftank.android cat "<path>"' > local.aneprof
```

The validator output `unknown event type 1792 at offset N` (1792 = 0x0700,
i.e. `EventType::Alloc << 8`) is the canonical symptom of CRLF-corrupted
pulls. Re-pulling with `exec-out` resolves it.
